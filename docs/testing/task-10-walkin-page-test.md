## Business Logic Implementation

### Slot Claiming Process
1. **Initial Queue Check**: Displays current queue status before registration
2. **Form Submission**: Validates and submits patient information  
3. **API Processing**: Walk-In API searches for available slots within ±15 min window
4. **Result Handling**: 
   - **Slot Available**: Updates appointment with patient info, shows appointment time
   - **No Slots**: Creates walk-in record, shows queue position
5. **Queue Update**: Refreshes queue status to reflect new patient

### Queue Management Integration
1. **Real-Time Display**: Shows current queue statistics before registration
2. **Business Hours**: Validates operating hours and disables form when closed
3. **Position Tracking**: After registration, displays patient's position in queue
4. **Wait Time Estimation**: Provides estimated wait times based on queue length

## Technical Implementation Notes
